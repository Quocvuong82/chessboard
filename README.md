### Chessboard

**Chessboard** is a standalone **UCI-compatible** chess board. 
It provides a chess board interface to Internet Chess Servers like FICS and it is compatible to UCI chess engines.
You can play against an engine or with other people over the Internet. It is also possible to **save your games** in a MySQL-Database. You can always **ask an engine** to tell you what the best moves in your position are. It is also possible to **watch** chess tournaments over the FICS-relay service.
